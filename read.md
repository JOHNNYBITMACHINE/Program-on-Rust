Rust is a modern systems programming language designed for performance, safety, and concurrency. Developed by Mozilla, it emphasizes memory safety without needing a garbage collector, thanks to its unique ownership system. Rust is often used for applications where reliability and speed are critical, such as operating systems, game engines, and web servers. Its growing ecosystem and strong compile-time checks make it a popular choice for both low-level and high-level programming tasks.
